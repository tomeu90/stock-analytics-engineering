      Staging table for Finviz news sentiment data, containing the same records as
      `news_scores_data` with standardized column naming and explicit data type
      casting applied. This model serves as a typed, cleaned representation of the
      enriched news dataset for reliable downstream transformations and analysis.
      Continuation of the `int_news_union` intermediate model, enriched with
      sentiment analysis scores generated using the VADER algorithm. This table
      fetches and parses the HTML content of each news article URL to extract the
      full text, which is then used to compute sentiment metrics.
